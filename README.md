This repository contains solutions from part 0-13 of the exercises from the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/)'s [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course. Full stack open is an excellent introduction to modern web development, where you can learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, and TypeScript. The focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS using REST APIs built with Node.js.

## Course content
